# React/Typescript Quiz App

I devloped this project, following one of [Thomas Weibenfalk's video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2JCjVSZlG0), as an exercise to understand how to utilise Typescript in tandem with React.

I added some additional styling and functionality to the project once completed, including the ability to select a category and difficulty for the quiz.

## Instructions

Clone the repo, install dependencies and run with (`npm start`)
